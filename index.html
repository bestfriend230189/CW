<h1>Inside One of America’s Ugliest Political Feuds: Cuomo vs. de Blasio
</h1>
<p class="first">It was, almost without question, the low point of Andrew M. Cuomo’s political career.</p>
<p class="second">The year was 2002 and Mr. Cuomo was badly trailing in the Democratic primary for governor and desperately seeking a
    graceful exit.</p>
<p>He needed a loyal <span class="span">lieutenant,someone to help him salvage his future</span> and negotiate the delicate terms of political
    surrender.</p>
<span>lieutenant,someone to help him salvage his future</span>
<p class="third">Mr. Cuomo turned to a trusted former colleague: Bill de Blasio.</p>
<p>And so, in a weekend of secret shuttle diplomacy, Mr. de Blasio, then a junior New York City councilman, did just
    that. Along with a cast that included President Bill Clinton, Mr. de Blasio was an indispensable emissary as Mr.
    Cuomo quit the race and endorsed his opponent, H. Carl McCall. It was the start of a fence-mending mission that
    would eventually land Mr. Cuomo the governorship eight years later.</p>
<p>The idea of Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo ever collaborating on anything seems almost unfathomable nearly 16 years
    later. The two Democrats are now engaged in a feud so nasty, petty and prolonged that even in the cutthroat politics
    of New York, few can remember ever seeing anything quite like it.</p>

<!--<div class="right">In their own way, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio both are vying to define the Democratic Party’s future in New York and beyond: the mayor as a progressive beacon for unrepentant liberalism succeeding, the governor as a deal-cutting Democrat who can actually make good on progressive promises.</div>-->
